  <title>NFL Confidence Pool Interest Email</title>
</head>
  <body>
    <p>Hello,</p>
    <p>You are getting this email because you either indicated an interest in participating in this year's 
    confidence pool or we thought you would be interested. All players are welcome, so even if you are not interested, 
    please feel free to forward this along appropriately.</p>
    <p>For those of you who have never done a confidence pool before, they are very easy to do. The objective is to 
    pick the winner of each game for the current week. When making your selections, you will assign a point value, 
    or "confidence" value, based on how sure you are of each pick. 1 means it could go either way and 16 means it's 
    a sure thing. If you are right, you win that amount of points and highest point total wins. Payouts are done to 
    the winner each week and top 3 places at the end for the overall score. More general details about confidence pools 
    can be found at the link here: <a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?How-to-Play-Fantasy-Football-Confidence-Pools&id=2596977">How to Play NFL Confidence Pools</a></p>
    <p><strong>Registering</strong></p>
    <p>You will need to click the link below (or copy and paste it into your browser), and then register. You have 
    the option of registering with an email and password, or with a Facebook or Google account. You also have the 
    option of registering with email and then linking your Facebook and/or Google account, allowing you one click 
    sign ins with all three methods. This is what I recommend though not required.</p>
    <p><strong>Register here: </strong><a href="http://nfl.asitewithnoname.com">nfl.asitewithnoname.com</a></p>
    <p>Once you are fully registered, you will be able to sign in and start making picks. The pool contains full 
    information on how to make your picks and play, however if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact 
    me at this email address, or by using the chat on the main menu.</p>
    <p>The cost for this pool is $30 per person for the whole season. Please pay by the end of the third week of the 
    season (before the end of Monday, September 26th, 2016). Payouts will be announced after that and will be based 
    on how many people sign up. The more people who participate the better, as the payouts will be higher, so invite 
    anyone who you think may be interested.  New players will be accepted up until the start of the third week and 
    will be assigned the number of points from the lowest score for the previous weeks.</p>
    <br/>

Bootstrap 4 Beta Notes (Upgraded from Bootstrap 4 alpha)
	- You cannot have anything other than a .col inside a row
	- .col can have anything inside it but another .col (must use a .row then the .col)
	- There is no more -xs modifier (i.e. col-xs-12 is now just col-12)
	- There is no more offset class (i.e. offset-md-3 is gone (MAY be added back in beta v2)).  Instead, you can use ml-auto to push a column to the far right (or mr-auto to the far left)
	- There is no more hidden class (i.e. hidden-md-up).  Use the display utility classes instead (i.e. d-md-none).
	- Print specific classes now exist for things like display: none (i.e. d-print-none)

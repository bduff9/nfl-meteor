    <p>Hello,</p>
    <p>You are getting this email because you either indicated an interest in participating in this year's
    confidence pool or we thought you would be interested. All players are welcome, so even if you are not interested,
    please feel free to forward this along appropriately.</p>
    <p>For those of you who have never done a confidence pool before, they are very easy to do. The objective is to
    pick the winner of each game for the current week. When making your selections, you will assign a point value,
    or "confidence" value, based on how sure you are of each pick. 1 means it could go either way and 16 means it's
    a sure thing. If you are right, you win that amount of points and the player with the highest point total wins. Payouts are done to
    the winner(s) each week and top 3 places at the end for the overall score. More general details about confidence pools
    can be found at the link here:</p>

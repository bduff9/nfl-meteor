Questions
	- Where did we land on picking by spread?
	- In quick pick email, should we only have 2 buttons (one for home team, one for away)?  Or should we somehow let them pick points as well (maybe with more buttons)?  There's a lot of ways we can handle this so really just want to start with do we only let them pick team (and we auto-assign highest, lowest or random point) or do we let them somehow pick points as well?  Once we decided on that, then if we let them pick points, do we have all available points, only the highest and lowest, etc.?

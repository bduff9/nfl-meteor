For BA
	- Where did we land on picking by spread?
	- In quick pick email, should we only have 2 buttons (one for home team, one for away)?  Or should we somehow let them pick points as well (maybe with more buttons)?  There's a lot of ways we can handle this so really just want to start with do we only let them pick team (and we auto-assign highest, lowest or random point) or do we let them somehow pick points as well?  Once we decided on that, then if we let them pick points, do we have all available points, only the highest and lowest, etc.?
	- New Tooltip component for help on confusing screens, feel free to see the EditProfile.jsx file for how to add to any screen you feel needs more help
	- Add twilio creds to all settings.json files if you have not already
	- Ensure all emails listed above in Emails are done, have the proper data substitutions, and look nice.  Also, if I forgot an email above, please add it.  When done, remove from the list above please.
